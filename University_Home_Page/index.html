                <p>I started on the wrong course for me but was supported greatly in the transition to something better suited! All the stuff are so lovely and I feel truly cared for by my teachers. I have learned so much already and have been inspired from being surrounded by so much passion and talent. There are so many opportunities to play and create in a range of ensembles, and I am happy here.</p>

                <p>really good facilities (library and sports in particular) and Dune itself is a lovely and a great and beautiful place to live. a way of improvement would be more safety precautions as there have been a few attacks and incidents in the area.</p>
